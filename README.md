# Main objectives
We wanted to understand :

- the overall performance of the team
- how much each person was producing
- the average operating time
- the number of large packages
- the total number of routes dispatched by each person
- the total number of packages dispatched on the day
- and also how many routes were up and how many were down

With this information, management could take stock of the team and monitor its performance on a daily basis. We could understand how the performance of the operation was influenced by the number of large packages, which, in addition to being heavier, were in a separate location in the operation, requiring more time to retrieve. Dispatching routes at the bottom was more difficult and required more from the employee than dispatching at the top. If an employee dispatched 10 more routes than another, this is not normal; the manager should assess the situation in the most humane and sensitive way possible. All of this was possible with this tool that I developed. It was possible to have an x-ray of the operation with what was extracted from the database. 

It was not developed overnight, it took several weeks of improvement, as new demands were observed, new functionalities were added to the tool, until one day it became something that management requested daily.

The latest update brought with it the possibility of looking at employee by employee, at different aspects of behavior. Everything that was already seen day by day could now be seen with a filter in a final graph. Each graph spoke about a different responsibility and the manager could see person by person or could also combine up to 4 people at a time and make a comparison.
